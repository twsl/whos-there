The spiritual successor to [knockknock](https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock) for [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning), to get a notification when your training is complete or when it crashes during the process with a single callback.


## Features

- Supports E-Mail, Discord, Slack, Teams, Telegram


## Installation

With `pip`:
```bash
python -m pip install whos-there
```

With [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/):
```bash
poetry add whos-there
```

With `conda`:

```bash
conda install conda-forge::whos-there
```
Check [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/whos-there-feedstock) for more information.


## How to use it

```python
import lightning.pytorch as pl
from whos_there.callback import NotificationCallback
from whos_there.senders.debug import DebugSender

trainer = pl.Trainer(
    callbacks=[
        NotificationCallback(senders=[
            # Add your senders here
            DebugSender(),
        ])
    ]
)
```

### E-Mail
Requires your e-mail provider specific SMTP settings.

```python
from whos_there.senders.email import EmailSender
# ...
EmailSender(
    host="smtp.example.de",
    port=587,
    sender_email="from@example.com",
    password="*********",
    recipient_emails=[
        "to1@example.com",
        "to2@example.com",
    ]
)
```

### Discord
Requires your Discord channel's [webhook URL](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks).

```python
from whos_there.senders.discord import DiscordSender
# ...
DiscordSender(
    webhook_url="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
)
```

### Slack
Requires your Slack room [webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks#create_a_webhook) and optionally your [user id](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.identity) (if you want to tag yourself or someone else).

```python
from whos_there.senders.slack import SlackSender
# ...
SlackSender(
    webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",   # gitleaks:allow
    channel="channel_name",
    user_mentions=[
        "XXXXXXXX"
    ]
)
```

### Teams
Requires your Team Channel [webhook URL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/connectors/connectors-using).

```python
from whos_there.senders.teams import TeamsSender
# ...
TeamsSender(
    webhook_url="https://XXXXX.webhook.office.com/",
    user_mentions=[
        "twsl"
    ]
)
```

### Telegram
You can also use Telegram Messenger to get notifications. You'll first have to create your own notification bot by following the three steps provided by Telegram [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and save your API access `TOKEN`.
Telegram bots are shy and can't send the first message so you'll have to do the first step. By sending the first message, you'll be able to get the `chat_id` required (identification of your messaging room) by visiting `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates` and get the `int` under the key `message['chat']['id']`.

```python
from whos_there.senders.telegram import TelegramSender
# ...
TelegramSender(
    chat_id=1234567890,
    token="XXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
)
```

poetry run mkdocs build -f ./docs/mkdocs.yml -d ./_build/
```


## Conda

The conda repository is maintained [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/whos-there-feedstock).


## Update template

copier update --trust
```
